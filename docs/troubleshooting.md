## Connecting to VMs Using SSH/RDP
- To debug Linux VMs, SSH can be used to login to the machines for troubleshooting and viewing log files. 
- To debug Windows VMs, a RDP client such as Windows Remote Desktop on Windows or xfreerdp on Linux can be used to login to the machines for troubleshooting and viewing log files.
- Workstation VMs are not exposed to the internet and do not have public IPs, a bastion host such as the DC or Connector can be used to access the Workstation VMs on the private network.

### Connecting to CentOS Workstations
- One way to access CentOS Workstations is to use the Connector as a bastion host. Please refer to the log tables below for the corresponding <login-user> for each VM.
- Use the -i flag to provide SSH with the private key that pairs with the public keys specified in terraform.tfvars.
- For GCP, enter the private key path that pairs with cac_admin_ssh_pub_key_file for the Connector or centos_admin_ssh_pub_key_file for CentOS Workstations.
- For AWS, enter the private key path that pairs with admin_ssh_pub_key_file for the Connector and CentOS Workstations.

Execute the following command to first SSH into the Connector:

```ssh -A -i </path/to/ssh-private-key> <login-user>@<cac-public-ip>``` 

From inside the Connector, execute the following command to SSH into the CentOS Workstation:

```ssh <login-user>@<centos-internal-ip>```

### Connecting to Windows Workstations
One way to access Windows Workstations is to use the Domain Controller as a bastion host. Use the following credentials to connect to the DC using a RDP client:

```
Computer: <domain-controller-public-ip>
User: Administrator
Password: <dc_admin_password_set_in_terraform.tfvars>
```

From inside the Domain Controller, connect to the Windows Workstation by using Windows RDP and entering the following login credentials:

```
Computer: <win-internal-ip>
User: Administrator
Password: <dc_admin_password_set_in_terraform.tfvars>
```
