#   Secrets   #
###############
# The secrets below may be supplied in 2 formats:
#   1. plain text
#   2. AWS KMS encrypted, base64 encoded
#
# For option 1, leave "customer_master_key_id" commented out and enter the
# plaintext passwords as strings in the variables below. Note that plaintext
# passwords may show in Terraform logs and .tfstate files, appear unencrypted
# in the storage bucket holding the startup scripts, as well as in the startup
# scripts once downloaded by the VMs.
#
# For option 2, a user encrypts the secrets independent of these Terraform
# scripts. Once the secrets are encrypted with an AWS KMS customer managed
# Customer Master Key (CMK), set "customer_master_key_id" to key ID used to
# encrypt the secrets, and enter the base64-encoded ciphertext as strings in the
# variables below. The AWS IAM account corresponding to the
# "aws_credentials_file" above must have admin permissions to manage the CMK
# specified.
#
# Note Windows password complexity requirements:
# 1. Must not contain user's account name or display name
# 2. Must have 3 of the following categories:
#    a. a-z
#    b. A-Z
#    c. 0-9,
#    d. (~!@#$%^&*_-+=`|\(){}[]:;"'<>,.?/)
#    3. unicode characters
# See: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/password-must-meet-complexity-requirements

# Uncomment and enter the Customer Master Key ID if using encryption.
# customer_master_key_id = "<key-id-uuid>"
