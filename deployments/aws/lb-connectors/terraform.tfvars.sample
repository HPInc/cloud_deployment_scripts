#   Secrets   #
###############
# The secrets below may be supplied in 2 formats:
#   1. plain text
#   2. AWS KMS encrypted, base64 encoded
#
# For option 1, leave "customer_master_key_id" commented out and enter the
# plaintext passwords as strings in the variables below. Note that plaintext
# passwords may show in Terraform logs and .tfstate files, appear unencrypted
# in the storage bucket holding the startup scripts, as well as in the startup
# scripts once downloaded by the VMs.
#
# For option 2, a user encrypts the secrets independent of these Terraform
# scripts. Once the secrets are encrypted with an AWS KMS customer managed CMK,
# set the "customer_master_key_id" to key ID used to encrypt the secrets, and
# enter the base64-encoded ciphertext as strings in the variables below. The
# AWS IAM account corresponding to the "aws_credentials_file" above must have
# admin permissions to manage the CMK specified.

# (Optional) If using encryption, enter the CMK ID, in the form of a UUID, e.g.
# "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000". Otherwise, comment out.

# Note Windows password complexity requirements:
# 1. Must not contain user's account name or display name
# 2. Must have 3 of the following categories:
